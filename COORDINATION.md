# COORDINATION.md — Shared Task Board

Branch policy note: this session is pinned to `arena/1944e5a3-jack2` by the Arena
environment (work on any other branch is not tracked). Per the task brief we would
otherwise branch `session-<id>/<task>`; here the single session works on
`arena/1944e5a3-jack2` and that branch doubles as the integration branch for the
pull request to `main`.

Session ID: `arena-1944e5a3`

## Rules (from task brief)

- Work only in claimed scope; small frequent commits; `git pull --rebase` before push.
- Every table row carries an official source link; unverifiable values are left blank
  and listed on the Flagged for Review page.
- Personal information is anonymized; no personal information appears on the site.
- "Needs review" = published on Flagged for Review; does not block merge.
